Liquid Glass is the dynamic material Apple introduced across its platforms in June 2025: glass that blurs and refracts the content behind it, reflects light along its rim, reacts to touch like gel, and **melts into neighboring glass** as elements approach each other. **LiquidGlass is an independent, ground-up reimagining of that material for the Android ecosystem** — Kotlin/Android (Compose + Views) and React Native/Expo — built on **real optics** (signed-distance-field lensing in an AGSL runtime shader), not a static blur. It is not affiliated with or derived from Apple's implementation; it simply chases the same feel.

## Why this one

| | **LiquidGlass** | liquid-glass-react | Kyant0 / backdrop | Haze |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platform | Android (Compose + Views) + RN/Expo | Web React (Chrome only) | Compose Multiplatform | Compose Multiplatform |
| Edge refraction (true lensing) | ✅ AGSL SDF lens | ✅ SVG displacement | ✅ | ❌ (blur only) |
| **Liquid shape merging / morphing** | ✅ smooth-min SDF container, up to 8 shapes | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Chromatic dispersion | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Gel press interaction | ✅ scale + local bulge + rim flare | hover/click states | ✅ | ❌ |
| Graceful degradation | ✅ 3 tiers down to API 21 | ❌ breaks outside Chrome | API 33+ only | blur or scrim |
| Classic View system | ✅ | — | ❌ | ❌ |
| React Native / Expo | ✅ self-contained npm package | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Design-system coupling | none (foundation-only) | none | none | none |
| Optics unit-tested | ✅ shader math mirrored in Kotlin, 80+ tests | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## How it works

1. **Provider** — `Modifier.liquidGlassProvider(state)` records the backdrop content into a `GraphicsLayer` once per frame (zero extra recompositions; invalidation is tracked by the render graph).
2. **Glass** — each glass element re-projects the recorded backdrop through a `RenderEffect` chain: **blur → saturation boost → AGSL liquid-glass shader**.
3. **The shader** computes a signed distance field of the glass silhouette (the smooth-min union of up to 8 rounded rectangles), then per pixel: refracts the backdrop along a circular lens profile at the rim, bulges around the touch point, splits RGB for dispersion, tints, paints an angle-aware specular rim, and dithers against banding.
4. **Tiers** — Android 13+ (API 33) runs the full shader; Android 12 gets frosted blur + drawn rim; everything back to Android 5.0 gets a clipped backdrop with scrim + rim. You can cap the tier (accessibility/battery) but never exceed device capability.

Every formula in the shader has a line-for-line Kotlin mirror (`GlassMath`) covered by JVM unit tests — the optics are proven, not eyeballed.

}
```

### A glass toolbar in three lines

```kotlin
val glass = rememberLiquidGlassProviderState()

Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    // 1. The backdrop: everything that lives behind the glass.
    ScreenContent(Modifier.fillMaxSize().liquidGlassProvider(glass))

    // 2. Glass elements: siblings drawn above the provider — never inside it.
    Box(
        Modifier
            .align(Alignment.BottomCenter)
            .padding(24.dp)
            .liquidGlass(glass, GlassStyle.Regular.interactive())
    ) {
        Text("Liquid Glass", Modifier.padding(horizontal = 24.dp, vertical = 12.dp))
    }
}
```

### Styles

```kotlin
GlassStyle.Regular                          // the everyday material (iOS .regular)
GlassStyle.Clear                            // transparent, for media (iOS .clear)
GlassStyle.prominent(accent)                // tinted primary-action glass
GlassStyle.Regular.tinted(Color.Cyan)       // fluent variants
GlassStyle.Regular.interactive()            // gel press response

GlassStyle(                                 // or tune the optics yourself
    shape = GlassShape.RoundedRectangle(24.dp),
    blurRadius = 20.dp,
    refraction = GlassRefraction(height = 12.dp, amount = 16.dp),
    saturation = 1.5f,
    chromaticAberration = 0.4f,
    highlight = GlassHighlight(width = 2.dp, alpha = 0.5f),
)
```

### Liquid merging — the signature feature

The Android counterpart of Apple's `GlassEffectContainer`. Shapes closer than `spacing` melt into one liquid form; children entering/leaving the composition morph out of and into their neighbors:

```kotlin
val container = rememberLiquidGlassContainerState(glass)

LiquidGlassContainer(container, spacing = 40.dp) {
    Column(verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(16.dp)) {
        if (expanded) {
            ActionButton(Modifier.glassEffect(container, id = "edit", interactive = true))
            ActionButton(Modifier.glassEffect(container, id = "share", interactive = true))
        }
        MainFab(Modifier.glassEffect(container, id = "fab", shape = GlassShape.Circle))
    }
}
```

`Modifier.glassEffect` works at any nesting depth inside the container. Animate child positions normally — the merging follows for free.

### Components (foundation-only, zero Material dependency)

`GlassSurface` · `GlassButton` · `GlassIconButton` · `GlassCard` · `GlassBottomBar`

### Accessibility / fidelity control

```kotlin
CompositionLocalProvider(LocalLiquidGlassTier provides GlassRenderTier.SCRIM) {
    // reduced-transparency subtree: scrim + rim, no live backdrop sampling
}
```

## Classic Views

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.abdullajon1881:liquidglass-view:1.0.0")
}
```

```kotlin
val provider = LiquidGlassProviderLayout(context).apply { addView(screenContent) }
val glass = LiquidGlassView(context).apply {
    this.provider = provider
    blurRadiusDp = 20f
    refractionAmountDp = 12f
    isGlassInteractive = true
}
root.addView(provider)   // backdrop below
root.addView(glass)      // glass above, as a sibling
```

Need glass on a view class you can't subclass? Embed `GlassViewController` directly — four forwarded calls and any `ViewGroup` becomes glass (this is exactly how the React Native module is built).

## React Native / Expo

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/liquid-glass-kit?logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liquid-glass-kit)

```bash
npx expo install liquid-glass-kit
```

```tsx
import { LiquidGlassProvider, LiquidGlassView } from 'liquid-glass-kit';

<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <LiquidGlassProvider style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}>
    <YourScreen />
  </LiquidGlassProvider>

  <LiquidGlassView style={styles.toolbar} interactive chromaticAberration={0.3}>
    <Text>Liquid Glass</Text>
  </LiquidGlassView>
</View>
```

- **One self-contained package.** The entire Android engine is vendored inside
  it — `npm install` and rebuild is all it takes; no Maven dependency to add.
- **Android**: the full AGSL pipeline with the same tier degradation as the native artifact.
- **Cross-platform safe**: on iOS and web the components are a transparent
  passthrough `View` — children render normally, nothing crashes — so the same
  code is safe to ship in any React Native / Expo app. The glass itself is
  Android-only. Check `isLiquidGlassSupported` if you want to branch your UI.

See [packages/liquid-glass-kit](packages/liquid-glass-kit/README.md) for details.

## Rendering tiers

| Tier | Requirements | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| `SHADER` | Android 13+ (API 33) | Refraction, dispersion, merging, gel bulge, rim light, blur, saturation, grain |
| `BLUR` | Android 12 (API 31–32) | Frosted blur + saturation, clipped shape, drawn rim, tint |
| `SCRIM` | Android 5.0+ (API 21) | Translucent scrim over the (clipped) backdrop + rim |

## Performance notes

- One backdrop recording per provider per frame, shared by all glass elements.
- The AGSL program compiles once per node; per-frame work is uniform updates only.
- Glass layers are inflated just enough (`2·blur + |refraction|`) that blur kernels never sample clamped edges.
- Modifier-node implementation (no composed modifiers, no recomposition on scroll — invalidation rides the snapshot/render graph).
- Keep glass to chrome — bars, buttons, cards, overlays. Don't glaze entire screens; Apple doesn't either.

## Rules of the material

1. Glass elements draw **above** the provider, never inside its subtree (a glass node inside the backdrop would sample its own recording).
2. One provider per `LiquidGlassProviderState`.
3. Containers support up to 8 merged shapes — far more than tasteful design needs.
4. Content on glass is yours to style; the library imposes no text color. Verify contrast in both light and dark contexts.
